    <h1> Grilled Cheese</h1>
    <h2>(un fromage grillé) </h2>

    <p> There is no such thing as perfect grilled cheese, Its all about the love that was made into it. </p>
    <H3> Grab Your Ingredients:</H3>
<ul>
   <ul>Bread- a thicker sliced bread such as texas toast work best. </ul> 
   <ul>Butter- use a generous 1/2 Tbsp of  butter on each slice of bread. We use unsalted but any butter will work here.</ul>

</ul>

   <H4>Lets Make Ourselves a Grilled Cheese:</H4>
<ol>
    <li> Butter the toast-spread 1/2 Tbsp butter on one side of each slice of bread. </li>
    <li> Heat skillet-place a skillet over low to medium/low heat. A griddle should be at 275˚F. Immediately add 2 slices of bread with the butter-side-down. </li>
    <li> Add cheese-stack cheeses on one of the pieces of bread, cover with the other piece of toast and flip the sandwich over.</li>
    <li> Brown the toast-Continue sauteeing, flipping once, until both sides are golden brown and cheese is melted.</li>
    <li>Serve-cut the sandwich in half on the diagonal to serve.</li>
